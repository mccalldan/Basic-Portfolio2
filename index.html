		<p>I like to think of myself as a Jack of All Trades. I am well-rounded with many interests such as sports, outdoor hobbies, fitness, movies, comedy, travel, food, drinks, art, and music. 

		I have always lived in smaller towns, but I do enjoy city life and the high energy that comes with cities. Meeting people from various parts of the country and the world is interesting to me.
